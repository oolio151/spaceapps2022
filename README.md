# For NASA Space Apps 2022
We created what we call the Hi-Roh project. Hi-Roh is an online resource that simplifies a difficult concept for kids. Our website is designed to educate kids about the consequences of space travel on living things. Since our website is a digital platform that lets people investigate the environmental pressures of space flight and learn about how various creatures adapt to them, it provides a response to the problem. For our project, we created a biological hero we call "Hi-Roh." His intense upbringing on an alien planet has given him a head start in terms of biology. Hi-Roh serves as a model organism since he can withstand the harsh conditions of interplanetary flight without any effects.
