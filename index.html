    <p id="bodytext">People often think that space is cold, but in reality, space doesn't have a temperature. Space is a vacuum, which means that there is no air and nearly no matter in space. This means that there is no way for heat to transfer from one object to another. Space is also very dark. The sun is the only source of light in space. The sun is so far away that it is very dim. The sun is so dim that it is hard to see in space. When a vacuum is suddenly broken, the air in a person's lungs will likely burst and kill them if they don't get rid of that air right away. This is why astronauts have to wear spacesuits.</p>

    <h3>Gravity: </h3>
    <p>   Gravity is the force that pulls objects towards each other. For example, when we drop an apple it 
    falls to the ground. However, in space there is no gravity. This means that when you drop the apple in space,
    it will float around. This is because there is no force pulling it down.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Pressure: </h3>
    <p>   Pressure can be seen all around us. For example, when air is sucked out of a drinking straw, 
    the air pressure inside drops, and the air pressure outside pushes the liquid into the straw. However,
    in space there is no pressure. Therefore, astronauts have to wear special space suits. If no space suit is
    worn, the person's body fluids will turn into gas, resulting in death in a few seconds.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Temperature: </h3>
    <p>   Temperature is the measure of how hot or cold something is. For example, when we touch a hot stove,
    we feel the heat. However, in space there is no temperature. This means that there is no heat or cold.
    This is why astronauts perceive space as being cold.</p>
